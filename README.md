# RabbitMQ_with_MERN

This project demonstrates a simple message queue architecture using **RabbitMQ**, integrated with a **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It features:

- A **Producer** service (Node.js) to send messages.
- A **Backend** service (Node.js + Express) that receives messages and broadcasts them via **Socket.IO**.
- A **Frontend** (React + Vite) that listens for real-time messages and displays them like a chat.
